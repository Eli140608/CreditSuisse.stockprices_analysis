# CreditSuisse.stockprices_analysis
For our school project, we undertook a comprehensive business intelligence initiative using Talend, MySQL, and Power BI. Our objective was to analyze the dataset "2023 Collapsed Banks Stock Prices 2017-2023 Credit Suisse (CS.csv)" and derive meaningful insights. By harnessing the capabilities of Talend for data integration, MySQL for data storage, and Power BI for visualization, we aimed to showcase the end-to-end process of business intelligence.
